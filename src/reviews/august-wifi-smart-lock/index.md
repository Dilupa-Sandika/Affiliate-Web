# August Wi-Fi Smart Lock: The Real-World Review

After 6 months of daily use in Las Vegas heat, here's my honest review of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. I'll cover everything from installation frustrations to summer performance, because most reviews don't tell you what it's really like to live with a smart lock every day.

## **Quick Summary**

**Rating: 4.2/5 stars**

The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is a solid choice for homeowners who want smart lock features without replacing their existing deadbolt. It's not perfect, but after 6 months of use, I'd buy it again.

**Best for:** Homeowners with existing deadbolts, renters, anyone wanting to keep their current keys
**Skip if:** You want the sleekest design, have a tight budget, or need rock-solid WiFi reliability

---

## **What Makes August Different**

Unlike most smart locks that require you to replace your entire deadbolt, the August lock **retrofits to your existing hardware**. This means:

- ‚úÖ Your exterior door looks unchanged
- ‚úÖ Your existing keys still work
- ‚úÖ Installation is typically easier
- ‚ùå The interior gets much bulkier

## **Installation Experience: Easier Than Expected**

**Time Required:** 30 minutes
**Tools Needed:** Screwdriver (included), measuring tape
**Difficulty:** 3/10 (surprisingly easy)

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Remove existing thumb turn** (2 minutes)
2. **Measure deadbolt dimensions** with included gauge (5 minutes)
3. **Install mounting plate** (10 minutes)
4. **Attach August unit** (5 minutes)
5. **Calibrate in app** (8 minutes)

### **Installation Gotchas:**
- **Door thickness matters** - measure twice before ordering
- **Some deadbolts aren't compatible** - check August's compatibility tool first
- **WiFi setup** takes longer than Bluetooth-only models

The included installation guide is actually helpful, unlike most tech products. I appreciated the physical gauge for checking compatibility.

## **Daily Performance: 6 Months In**

### **üîí Locking/Unlocking Reliability: 9/10**

In 6 months of daily use, the lock has failed to operate maybe 5-6 times. Usually resolved by:
- Opening/closing the August app
- Checking door alignment (sometimes the door sticks in Vegas heat)

**Auto-unlock works about 95% of the time** when arriving home. The 5% failures were usually when I approached from an odd angle or my phone was in my back pocket.

### **üì± App Experience: 7/10**

**What Works Well:**
- Quick lock/unlock from anywhere
- Activity history is detailed and useful
- Guest access is simple to manage
- Battery level monitoring

**Frustrations:**
- App sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to connect
- Occasionally shows "offline" when lock is actually fine
- Guest codes expire at midnight, not 24 hours later (annoying for Airbnb)

### **üîã Battery Life: 6/10**

This is where August loses points. **Battery life is inconsistent and shorter than advertised.**

**My Experience:**
- **First 3 months:** 4-5 months estimated life
- **Summer heat (105¬∞F+):** Dropped to 2-3 months estimated
- **Actual replacement:** Every 3.5 months on average

**Battery Tips I Learned:**
- Buy rechargeable CR123A batteries (way cheaper long-term)
- Heat definitely affects battery life
- Auto-unlock drains battery faster than manual use

---

## **Vegas-Specific Performance Notes**

Living in Las Vegas presents unique challenges for smart home devices:

### **üå°Ô∏è Heat Performance: 8/10**
- **Summer temps 110¬∞F+:** Lock continued working normally
- **Direct sun exposure:** No warping or malfunction
- **Battery drain:** Increased by about 30% in summer months

### **üè† Dust/Wind Resistance: 9/10**
- **Monsoon season:** No issues with dust or moisture
- **Daily dust:** Easy to clean, no accumulation in moving parts

### **üì∂ WiFi in Vegas Homes: 7/10**
- **Stucco walls:** Can interfere with WiFi signal strength
- **Two-story homes:** May need WiFi extender for reliable connection

---

## **Smart Home Integration**

### **Amazon Alexa: 9/10**
"Alexa, lock the front door" works perfectly every time. No complaints here.

### **Google Assistant: 8/10**
Works well, but requires saying "ask August to lock the door" instead of direct commands.

### **Apple HomeKit: N/A**
August doesn't support HomeKit natively, which is a dealbreaker for some iOS users.

---

## **Security Features**

### **üîê Auto-Lock: 8/10**
- **Customizable timing:** 30 seconds to 30 minutes
- **Reliability:** Works about 98% of the time
- **Peace of mind:** I never worry about leaving the door unlocked

### **üö® Tamper Detection: 7/10**
- Sends alerts if someone tries to remove the lock
- Sometimes gives false positives during heavy wind

### **üìú Activity Log: 9/10**
- Detailed history of every lock/unlock
- Shows battery level over time
- Great for tracking kids' arrivals home

## **What I Love After 6 Months**

### **1. No More Lost Key Panic**
My teenage daughter loses everything, but her phone is permanently attached to her hand. Problem solved.

### **2. Guest Access is Brilliant**
Giving temporary access to housekeepers, dog sitters, or Airbnb guests without physical keys is incredibly convenient.

### **3. Package Deliveries**
I can unlock the door for delivery drivers and relock immediately. Game-changer for expensive packages.

### **4. Activity Monitoring**
Knowing exactly when my kids get home from school gives me peace of mind without being overbearing.

---

## **What Drives Me Crazy**

### **1. The Size**
The interior unit is **huge**. It makes my entryway look clunky and catches on clothing sometimes.

### **2. WiFi Connectivity**
Maybe once a week, the lock shows "offline" in the app even though it's working fine. Requires opening/closing the app.

### **3. Battery Anxiety**
Getting low battery alerts when I'm traveling is stressful. The lock still works, but worry about being locked out.

### **4. Guest Code Timing**
Guest codes expire at midnight, not 24 hours after creation. This has caused problems with cleaning services arriving early.

---

## **Cost Analysis: Is It Worth $229?**

### **Value Comparison:**
- **August Wi-Fi:** $229 (keeps existing deadbolt)
- **Yale Assure:** $279 (full deadbolt replacement)
- **Schlage Encode:** $249 (full replacement)

### **Hidden Costs:**
- **Batteries:** ~$20/year (CR123A rechargeable recommended)
- **Professional installation:** $50-100 if you don't DIY

### **Savings:**
- **No locksmith calls:** $150+ each time
- **No key replacement:** $50+ for rekeying after lost keys

**Verdict:** Worth it if you value convenience and security. The time saved and peace of mind justify the cost.

---

## **Long-Term Durability**

After 6 months of Vegas weather and daily use:

### **Physical Condition: 9/10**
- No visible wear on the exterior
- Interior plastic shows minor scuffs
- All buttons still tactile and responsive

### **Mechanical Performance: 8/10**
- Lock mechanism still smooth
- Calibration hasn't drifted
- No grinding or unusual sounds

---

## **Who Should Buy the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock?**

### **‚úÖ Perfect For:**
- **Renters** who can't replace the deadbolt
- **Homeowners** with high-quality existing hardware
- **Families** wanting keyless entry without full door modification
- **Anyone** who wants to keep existing keys as backup

### **‚ùå Consider Alternatives If:**
- **Design matters** - this isn't the sleekest option
- **Budget is tight** - there are cheaper smart locks
- **WiFi is unreliable** - consider Bluetooth-only models
- **You want HomeKit** - August doesn't support it

---

## **Alternatives to Consider**

### **If You Want Sleeker Design:**
**Yale Assure Lock SL** - Much cleaner look, but requires deadbolt replacement

### **If You Want Lower Cost:**
**Wyze Lock** - Similar retrofit design for ~$100 less

### **If You Want Better Battery Life:**
**Schlage Encode** - Hardwired option with backup battery

---

## **Final Verdict: 4.2/5 Stars**

The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock isn't perfect, but it's a solid choice for most homeowners. After 6 months, I appreciate the convenience more than I'm bothered by the drawbacks.

### **Buy it if:** 
You want smart lock features without major door modification, and you can live with the bulky interior design.

### **Skip it if:** 
You prioritize sleek aesthetics or need rock-solid WiFi reliability for mission-critical applications.

**Would I buy it again?** Yes, but I'd also consider the newer August models that address some of my concerns.

---

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: Does it work during power outages?**
**A:** Yes, the lock runs on batteries and doesn't need WiFi to operate manually. You just lose remote access.

### **Q: Can burglars hack it?**
**A:** Like any connected device, there's theoretical risk. August uses bank-level encryption, and physical bypass is much more likely than digital.

### **Q: What happens if my phone dies?**
**A:** Your existing keys still work! This is the main advantage of August's retrofit design.

### **Q: Installation in apartments?**
**A:** Perfect for renters since it doesn't modify the existing deadbolt. Just remove it when you move.
