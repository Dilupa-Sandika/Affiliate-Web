# Kwikset Halo Touch: Fingerprint Convenience Meets Reality

## **Quick Verdict**

**Rating: 4.0/5 stars**

The Kwikset Halo Touch offers good value with fingerprint convenience and built-in WiFi, but the fingerprint reader struggles in extreme heat and the build quality feels budget-oriented despite decent features.

**Buy it if:** You want fingerprint access, value convenience over premium materials, and don't mind occasional reliability issues
**Skip it if:** You need consistent performance in extreme weather, prefer premium build quality, or require professional-grade security
