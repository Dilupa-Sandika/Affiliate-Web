# Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2: The Las Vegas Stress Test

After 8 months of grueling Las Vegas weather, constant deliveries, and the occasional desert windstorm, here's my comprehensive review of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2. This isn't just specs and features - it's real-world performance from someone who actually lives with this device every day.

## **Quick Verdict**

**Rating: 4.6/5 stars**

The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 is the best doorbell I've tested, especially if you have existing doorbell wiring. It's not cheap, but the reliability and features justify the cost for most homeowners.

**Buy it if:** You have doorbell wiring, want the best video quality, and don't mind a subscription
**Skip it if:** You're on a tight budget, don't have existing wiring, or want local storage only

---

## **Why I Chose the Pro 2**

After my previous battery-powered Ring doorbell started failing in Vegas winter (yes, that's a thing), I decided to go hardwired. The Pro 2 offers:

- **Hardwired power** - no battery anxiety
- **Higher resolution** - 1536p vs 1080p
- **3D Motion Detection** - fewer false alerts
- **Pre-Roll** - see 4 seconds before motion triggered

---

## **Installation: Surprisingly Smooth**

**Time Required:** 45 minutes
**Difficulty:** 4/10 (need basic electrical knowledge)
**Tools:** Wire strippers, screwdriver, drill

### **My Setup Process:**

1. **Turned off breaker** to doorbell circuit
2. **Removed old doorbell** and checked voltage (16V - perfect)
3. **Installed new mounting bracket** (required drilling 2 holes)
4. **Connected wires** (just two wires - simple)
5. **Attached Pro 2** and powered on
6. **App setup** (10 minutes of WiFi configuration)

**Installation Gotcha:** My 1970s doorbell transformer was only 8V. Had to upgrade to a 16V transformer ($25 + electrician $75). Check your voltage first!

## **Video Quality: Outstanding**

### **üìπ Resolution: 10/10**
- **1536p recording** is noticeably sharper than standard 1080p
- **HDR support** handles Vegas sun/shadow contrasts beautifully
- **Color Night Vision** works surprisingly well with porch light

### **üìê Field of View: 9/10**
- **150¬∞ horizontal, 90¬∞ vertical** captures entire porch area
- **Head-to-toe view** shows packages clearly
- **Wide enough** to see people approaching from sides

### **üé¨ Pre-Roll Feature: 9/10**
This is a game-changer. You get 4 seconds of video BEFORE motion was detected. Sounds minor, but it means you actually see the person walking up instead of just them already at your door.

## **Las Vegas Weather Performance**

### **‚òÄÔ∏è Summer Heat (110¬∞F+): 9/10**
- **No overheating** warnings during 115¬∞F days
- **Video quality** remained consistent in extreme heat
- **Hardwired power** eliminates battery heat issues
- **Direct sun glare** handled well with HDR

### **üå¨Ô∏è Dust/Wind Resistance: 8/10**
- **Monsoon survival:** No issues during heavy dust storms
- **Daily dust:** Easy to clean, no buildup affecting video
- **Wind:** Sturdy mounting, no vibration issues

### **‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter Performance: 10/10**
- **No cold weather failures** like my previous battery model
- **Consistent operation** down to 35¬∞F nights
- **Hardwired advantage** really shows in winter

---

## **3D Motion Detection: The Real MVP**

This feature alone justifies the Pro 2's higher price:

### **How It Works:**
- **Creates 3D zones** around your property
- **Learns the difference** between people, packages, and cars
- **Reduces false alerts** from shadows, leaves, cars

### **My Results:**
- **90% fewer false alerts** compared to standard motion detection
- **Package detection** works about 80% of the time
- **Person alerts** are 95% accurate

### **Vegas-Specific Benefits:**
- **Ignores tumbleweeds** (seriously, this was a problem before)
- **Handles delivery trucks** without constant alerts
- **Works with desert landscape** lighting changes

## **App Experience: Good with Caveats**

### **‚úÖ What Works Well:**
- **Live view** connects in 2-3 seconds
- **Two-way audio** is clear and responsive
- **Motion alerts** arrive within 10 seconds
- **Video history** is easy to browse
- **Guest sharing** works smoothly

### **‚ùå Frustrations:**
- **Occasional app crashes** (maybe once a week)
- **Live view timeout** after 10 minutes (security feature, but annoying)
- **Subscription required** for most useful features

### **üì± Ring Protect Subscription: Required**
**Cost:** $3/month or $30/year per device
**Includes:** Video history, smart alerts, snapshot capture

Without the subscription, you only get live view and basic motion alerts. The subscription is basically mandatory for useful functionality.

---

## **Smart Home Integration**

### **üîå Alexa Integration: 10/10**
- **"Show front door"** works instantly on Echo devices
- **Motion announcements** through Alexa speakers
- **Two-way talk** through Echo devices

### **üì± iOS/Android: 9/10**
- **Widgets** show recent activity
- **Lock screen notifications** with video preview
- **Siri shortcuts** for common commands

### **üè† SmartThings/HomeKit: 6/10**
- **Limited integration** with non-Amazon platforms
- **No HomeKit support** (dealbreaker for some)

---

## **Real-World Scenarios**

### **üì¶ Package Deliveries: 9/10**
**What I Love:**
- **Package alerts** when boxes are detected
- **Pre-roll** shows delivery approach
- **Two-way audio** for delivery instructions

**Minor Issue:** 
- **Package detection** misses flat envelopes sometimes

### **üö™ Visitor Management: 10/10**
- **Quick response** to doorbell presses
- **Clear audio** for conversations
- **Video quality** good enough to identify visitors clearly

### **üöó Vehicle/Pet False Alerts: 9/10**
- **3D detection** ignores cars in driveway
- **Pet detection** works for larger dogs, misses cats
- **Much better** than previous generation

## **Battery vs Hardwired: Why Hardwired Wins**

Having used both, here's why hardwired is superior in Vegas:

### **üîã Battery Doorbell Issues:**
- **Heat kills batteries** faster (3 months vs 6+ months advertised)
- **Cold weather failures** in winter
- **Charging anxiety** when traveling

### **‚ö° Hardwired Advantages:**
- **24/7 operation** without power concerns
- **Better video quality** (no power-saving mode)
- **Continuous recording** options
- **No weather-related power issues**

---

## **Installation Considerations**

### **‚úÖ You're Good to Go If:**
- **Existing doorbell wiring** present
- **16-24V transformer** (check with multimeter)
- **Strong WiFi signal** at front door
- **Willing to pay** for Ring Protect subscription

### **‚ùå Consider Alternatives If:**
- **No existing wiring** (battery model or hire electrician)
- **Weak WiFi signal** (need extender first)
- **Budget under $200** (get Ring Video Doorbell 4)
- **Want local storage** only (consider Eufy or Arlo)

---

## **Cost Analysis**

### **Upfront Costs:**
- **Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2:** $249
- **Installation:** $0-150 (DIY vs professional)
- **Transformer upgrade:** $0-100 (if needed)
- **Total initial:** $249-499

### **Ongoing Costs:**
- **Ring Protect subscription:** $30/year
- **5-year cost:** $399-649 total

### **Value Justification:**
- **Security peace of mind**
- **Package theft prevention** 
- **Convenience** of screening visitors
- **Home insurance** discounts (varies by provider)

- **Strong ecosystem** integration

### **What Holds It Back:**
- **Subscription requirement** for key features
