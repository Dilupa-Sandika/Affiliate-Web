# Vegas Tech Hub Blog System

This document explains the new blog system implementation for Vegas Tech Hub.

## 🎯 Overview

The blog system allows you to create personal tech experience stories as Markdown files. Each post includes a comment section powered by Giscus and is fully integrated with the existing website design.

```

## ✏️ Creating New Blog Posts

### 1. Create a new Markdown file
Create a new `.md` file in `src/blog/` with a descriptive filename:
```
src/blog/my-new-tech-story.md
```

### 2. Add the required frontmatter
Every blog post must start with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
layout: blog-post.njk
title: "Your Engaging Blog Post Title"
description: "A compelling description that appears in previews and social media"
date: 2025-08-13
tags: ["blog", "hometech", "diy", "problem-solving"]
featuredImage: "/assets/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
---
```

### 3. Write your content in Markdown
Use standard Markdown formatting:

```markdown
# Main Heading

## Section Heading

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bulleted lists
- Work great

1. Numbered lists
2. Also work

[Links work too](https://example.com)
```

## 🏷️ Tags and Categories

### Recommended Tags:
- `blog` - Always include this
- `hometech` - Smart home related
- `diy` - Do-it-yourself solutions  
- `wifi` - Network/connectivity issues
- `problem-solving` - General troubleshooting
- `remote` - TV remotes, controls
- `winter` - Cold weather issues
- `smart-home` - General smart home topics

### Categories for Organization:
The blog automatically categorizes posts based on tags:
- **Hardware Fixes**: Posts tagged with "diy"
- **Network Issues**: Posts tagged with "wifi" 
- **Smart Home**: Posts tagged with "hometech"
- **Money Saving**: Posts tagged with "problem-solving"

## 🖼️ Images

### Adding Featured Images:
1. Add your image to `src/assets/images/blog/`
2. Reference it in frontmatter: `featuredImage: "/assets/images/blog/your-image.jpg"`
3. Recommended size: 1200x630px for best social media sharing

### Adding Images in Content:
```markdown

No additional setup needed - comments will appear at the bottom of each post.
